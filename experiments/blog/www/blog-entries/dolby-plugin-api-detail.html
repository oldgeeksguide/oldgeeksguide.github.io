When I think of Dolby technology, I usually think of Movie theaters and high end stereos, adding life to soundtracks
and music.  It turns out that they've also been working on bringing some of that clever technology to hand-held devices.
This technology is designed to enhance different sorts of audio, including games, movies and music.
This is cool if you own one of these devices and can experience better audio, but it's also interesting to developers.
</p>

<p>
As an app developer, you want to be able to take advantage of this technology to maximum effect.  If you're designing
a game, you want to enhance it by ensuring that the Dolby game profile is active.  If you're playing music or video,
you'll want the appropriate profile active. <br />
Fortunately the Dolby Cordova Plugin makes that easy.
</p>

<p>
If all you want to do is enable Dolby functionality, that's easy.  The API relies on a <a href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/blogs/2014/09/05/cordova-plugins-and-the-dolby-api">Cordova Plugin</a> which is available as a featured plugin in the Intel XDK.
To access it, just go to the projects page, expand the "Plugins And Permissions" pane and check "Dolby Audio API".
This will cause the plugin to be loaded in your app, exposed as a global variable <code>dolby</code>.  For example,
if you want to enable the feature for your game, you just need add this code to your initialization code:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint"><code>var onDsConnected = function() {
    console.log("Dolby started successfully");
};
var onFail = function(err) {
    console.log("Dolby failed due to ", err);
};
dolby.dap.initialize(dolby.DapProfile.GAME, onDsConnected, onFail);
</code></pre>

<p>
Now, if all you care about is enabling it, this will be fine.  But you probably want something more
sophisticated, say if you want to switch to the music profile for interstitial music while loading a new level:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint"><code>dolby.setProfile(dolby.DapProfile.Music);
</code></pre>

<p>
The dolby API consists of three parts:
</p>

<ul>
<li>dolby.dap - contains the various functions like initialize and setProfile</li>
<li>dolby.DapProfile - contains the available profiles (<code>GAME</code>, <code>MUSIC</code>, 'VOICE<code>and</code>MUSIC`)</li>
<li>dolby.DapError - various error codes, provided as parameters to onFail callbacks</li>
</ul>

<p>
Aside from initializing and setting profiles, there are a few other convenient capabilities.
Suppose you've got things set up for your App, with the profile set for your wicked action packed game, but then
the user gets a phone call.  The user is, no doubt, saavy about these things and has his phone set to use the <code>VOICE</code>
profile, the better to hear his phone conversations.  You don't want to mess with that, so when the game is interrupted,
you want to defer to whatever the system setting is, and then go back to the <code>GAME</code> profile when it resumes.  The Dolby
API allows for that with the <code>suspendSession()</code> and <code>restartSession()</code> functions:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint"><code>onPause = function () {
    dolby.dap.suspendSession();
}
document.addEventListener("pause", onPause, false);


onResume = function () {
    var success = function () {
        console.log("Resuming OK");
    }
    var err = function () {
        console.log("Problem resuming");
    }

    dolby.dap.restartSession(success, err);
}
document.addEventListener("resume", onResume, false);
</code></pre>

<p>
There are a couple other functions, like <code>getSelectedProfile()</code> to check the current setting, and <code>release()</code> to
release control and go back to the system settings.  All the details can be found in the documentation available
at the github site - <a href="https://github.com/DolbyDev/Dolby-Audio-Plugin-for-Cordova">https://github.com/DolbyDev/Dolby-Audio-Plugin-for-Cordova</a> or at Dolby's developer site - <a href="http://developer.dolby.com">http://developer.dolby.com</a>.

And if you get a chance to try a device with this capability, check it out.  It makes the builtin speakers sound better, and works great with headphones!
